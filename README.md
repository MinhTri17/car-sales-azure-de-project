# Project Title
### | **Azure End-To-End Data Engineering Project**

# Project Description
- This project was built to support learning purpose which I followed the tutorial **"[Azure End-To-End Data Engineering Project (Job Ready) | Azure Data Engineering Bootcamp]"** by **[Ansh Lamba / https://www.youtube.com/@AnshLambaJSR]**.


- I followed and modified this tutorial on my own to practice modern Data Engineer tools: Azure cloud including many widely used services such as Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Dataricks, Unity Catalog. 
- **ðŸ“Œ Note:** I've added my own documentation, diagrams, and new components for the system. I also made custom adjustments to the guided parts to gain a deeper understanding of how each componenet functions.
